# Radar-HRV-Project
This project utilizes a Continuous-Wave (CW) radar sensor to capture heart-beat signals and process them in real time using a Raspberry Pi. The system performs signal acquisition, preprocessing, and heart-rate variability analysis directly on the embedded platform, demonstrating an efficient, low-cost approach for non-contact cardiac monitoring.
